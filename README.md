# Hi there, I'm Jaynil ðŸ‘‹

Data Engineer by trade, passionate about building robust data & ML pipelines that actually move the needle.  
Currently leveling up my MLOps and AI engineering skills to automate, scale, and productionize ML at work (and for fun).  

-  Working on: [MLOps Journey](https://github.com/jaynilsonavane/mlops-journey) â€” real-world experiments, learnings, and tools from the trenches
-  Deep diving into: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, and everything cloud-native
-  Always up for a challengeâ€”whether itâ€™s data engineering, analytics, or deploying ML at scale
-  Fun fact: If Iâ€™m not wrangling data, Iâ€™m probably geeking out over workflow automation or brewing a killer cup of coffee

Letâ€™s connect, collaborate, and ship something awesome!
